                Yehuda is able to incorporate the natural inclusion within the finished diamond by making it invisible
                 to the naked eye. The result of our cutting is a much larger diamond than anyone else can offer you. </p>

                  The diamond cutter is forced to cut this diamond so that the inclusion 
                  does not appear in the polished stone. The result of his cutting will be a small diamond.</p>

            	<img src="imgs/edPic5.png">
              <p>Yehuda inserts a microscopic amount of a proprietary substance into the inclusion, making it completely invisible to the naked eye. This unique material has the same optical properties as the diamond, so that light can now pass through the inclusion. 
              	The amount of material we use is so extraordinarily small that our competitors have never been able to extract it, study it, or copy it.</p>

              <p>The type of diamond inclusion called a “feather” is the only one we can make disappear. 
              	Although the “feather” is still there, you can not see it and neither can anyone else, not even a jeweler. The treatment can be reversed only by strong acid bases or a jeweler’s torch. In the extremely unlikely event that this would ever happen, we’ll be happy to re-enhance the diamond at no extra cost.extraordinarily small that our competitors have never been able to extract it, study it, or copy it.</p>
